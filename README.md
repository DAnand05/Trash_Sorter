# Problem Statement

In India, the issue of waste management stands as a significant challenge, given the country's burgeoning population and rapid urbanization. The pressing concern of waste disposal necessitates innovative solutions to mitigate its adverse impacts on society and the environment.

Amidst this backdrop, this research endeavors to address the urgent need for effective waste management strategies tailored to the Indian context. With an alarming rate of waste generation exceeding millions of tons daily, there is an imperative to raise awareness and facilitate proper waste classification and disposal practices.

This proposed model aims to contribute to the mitigation of this issue by offering a comprehensive classification system for seven distinct waste materials prevalent in India. By providing detailed insights into each waste category, including their characteristics and disposal methods, the model seeks to empower individuals and communities to make informed decisions towards waste reduction and recycling.

Through the dissemination of knowledge and the promotion of sustainable practices, this research aspires to foster a culture of environmental consciousness and stewardship among the populace, thereby contributing to the broader goal of a cleaner and healthier India.

# Overview

1. Here I've used trashnet Dataset, which is available freely at Kaggle.
2. There are 'cardboard', 'compost', 'glass', 'metal', 'paper', 'plastic', 'trash' total 7 different types of waste materials which are use for recycling.
3. Here i have 2187 images belonging 7 classes.
4. Here i have trained dataset using VGG16,RESNET50 model via using Transfer Learning technique of CNN for classification.
5. Here i have trained this model till 160 epochs and I used Google Colab GPU(T4) to train this model because I don't have that kind of GPU or CPU that can perform or train this model till even 60 epochs, if you have the necessary GPU power then do train it till 200 as it will increase accuracy.*
